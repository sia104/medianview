# implement-it

Use this skill to implement an approved specification.

Rules:
- Implement only from an approved specification in `specs/`.
- Do not redefine requirements or independently weaken acceptance criteria.
- If the approved specification is ambiguous, conflicting, or infeasible, stop and ask the human.
- For user-runnable software, create or update concise documentation covering
  setup or installation, launch, user access or use, and verification commands.
- Add or update deterministic tests for implemented behavior.
- Run the repository-defined deterministic quality gates before completion.
- Perform implementation and normal implementation checks, not independent
  adversarial verification.
- Do not merge; humans control merge.
