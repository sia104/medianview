# test-it

Independently verify an implementation against its approved specification.

Trust level: OBSERVE / REPORT ONLY.

Rules:
- Read the approved specification and acceptance criteria, then inspect the
  implementation and existing tests.
- Map each acceptance criterion to deterministic verification and identify
  criteria that are inadequately tested or remain unverified.
- At this trust level, propose appropriate missing automated tests; add tests
  only when a human separately authorizes file changes.
- Run the repository-defined test and quality gates.
- Report passes, failures, gaps, and unverified criteria clearly.
- Do not change product requirements, repair production or application code, or
  merge changes.
- Remain independent from `implement-it`: report implementation failures rather
  than silently repairing them.

Select only relevant testing layers:
1. Unit tests for functions, components, and deterministic algorithms.
2. Integration or API tests for component interactions, endpoints, formats, and
   boundaries.
3. Runtime or startup smoke tests that start the real process and verify it is
   reachable and responds correctly.
4. End-to-end UI tests that exercise a user interface with representative data.

Do not force irrelevant layers onto a project. Where practical, runtime and
end-to-end tests should avoid fragile assumptions such as fixed local ports.
